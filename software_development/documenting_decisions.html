<h2>
Documenting the decision making process
</h2>
<hr>

<br>

Communication is an essential human ability.
It is a complex skill to master and one of the keys to efficiency and success.<br>

<br>

And even though documentation as a form of communication
in information technology and telecommunications comes in various kinds,
it mostly describes the state of a subject
in terms of "what?" and "how?" but rarely "why?".<br>

<br>

The first type in such a dissection would be represented by<br>
<div indent>
    standards and specifications;<br>
    requests for comments;<br>
    guides for users, developers or administrators;<br>
    descriptions of any sort that could be references, diagrams, use-cases, readmes...;<br>
    manifests;<br>
    knowledge bases and others... â€”<br>
</div>
which are certainly necessary.<br>
And examples of the not as common second type would include<br>
<div indent>
    requirements,<br>
    comparisons,<br>
    commentaries to source code,<br>
    minutes of meetings,<br>
    mailing lists...<br>
</div>
These usually just complement the software development process.<br>

<br>

This note is to suggest or establish an idea of shifting the focus of documentation and
putting decisions in its core.
Beneficial points for consideration are all the general functions of documentation
but applied to the design disciplines in the software development process.<br>

<br>

Decisions inevitably become more conscious as they are explicitly documented.
The same unified process is applicable to the project governing
as its documentation is iteratively developed under a source code management system.
It allows observing the development direction.
The context sharing achieves effective collaboration on design tasks.
The clarity of intentions of all the interested parties helps decision adoption,
reduces probability of arguements and toxicity.<br>

<br>

One notable occurrence of this approach is
<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html" reference>
Google's C++ programming convention</a>.
It declares specifically that the guidances contain reasoning that
ground discussions, improve clarity and
draw boundaries for when the rules should be waived off.
This is a major step forward even despite
some style sections that contain formatting and naming recommendations
give no explanation.<br>

<br>

Another point to discuss is that projects rarely publish
any kinds of requirements, whether fuctional or nonfuctional.
Putting use cases alongside in the same repository or on an associated wiki
sounds to be a handy practice,
so one is able to follow
how a requirement becomes a set of elements in api, or
why a library gets chosen over another.<br>

<br>

Everything changes: conditions, requirements, technologies and even ourselves.
At some point during the solution's lifecycle there might come a time
to kick off a major redesign and reimplementation
or to sunset the project due to a successful competitor.
Such a time may be recognized during a retrospection of the founding documents.<br>

<br>

Given the effort required to create documentation is justified,
this approach draws a perspective of
upgrading a solution from being a system of decisions put together to
a form of communication itself.<br>
